This README outlines what each function does in regards to binary trees

0-binary_tree_node   	       - creates a new binary tree nodei

1-binary_tree_insert_left      - inserts a node as the left child of another node. if one already exists, it will replace that node and the old node will become the left-child of the new node

2-binary_tree_insert_right     - inserts a node as the right child of another node. If one already exists, it will replace thta node and the old node will become the right-child of the new node

3-binary_tree_delete 	       - deletes a whole tree

4-binary_tree_is_leaf 	       - checks if a node is a leaf

5-binary_tree_is_root 	       - checks if a node is root

6-binary_tree_preorder	       - goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

7-binary_tree_inorder	       - goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

8-binary_tree_postorder	       - goes through a binary using using post-order traversal

9-binary_tree_height 	       - goes through a binary tree and checks the height of the tree

10-binary_tree_depth	       - measures the depth of a node in a tree

11-binary_tree_size	       - measures the size of a binary tree

12-binary_tree_leaves	       - counts the leaves of a tree

13-binary_tree_nodes	       - counts the nodes with at least one child

14-binary_tree_balance	       - measures the balance of a binary tree
